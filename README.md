# 🧪 whatever.codes — Suraj's DevOps Playground

> "A lab where experiments meet documentation."

Welcome to **`whatever.codes`**, my personal space for experimenting with tools, workflows, and ideas—mostly around **DevOps**, automation, and platform engineering. This is a monorepo bootstrapped with [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo), designed to scale as I iterate on tools, write technical documentation, or prototype internal utilities.

## 📁 Structure

This monorepo follows the standard Turborepo layout:

```

.
├── apps/
│   └── web/            # Docs site layout (WIP)
├── packages/           # Shared packages / utilities (WIP)
├── .gitignore
├── turbo.json          # Turborepo config
├── package.json        # Root dependencies

````


## 🧱 Current Status

> 🚧 **Work in Progress** — This is the early layout phase.

I'm currently:

- Setting up the **web/docs app** inside `apps/web`
- Designing the markdown-first documentation/blog experience
- Planning future automation and DevOps tool integrations

---

## 📌 Goals

This repo will serve as:

- 🧪 A sandbox to explore **CI/CD**, **IaC**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and more
- 📄 A markdown-based system to write **internal notes**, **blogs**, and **tech writeups**
- 🛠️ A base for reusable **DevOps components**, scripts, and infra blueprints




## 📚 Docs Coming Soon

The idea is to self-host or deploy this on `https://whatever.codes` with:

* Posts/notes using MDX
* DevOps playbooks
* Tooling benchmarks and comparisons
* My learnings, tips, and mistakes
